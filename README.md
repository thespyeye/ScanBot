# ScanBot
Repository containing the source code of the currently WIP ScanBot project

The code is currently being rewritten from the ground up to:
A: Be compatible with Microchip Studio 7 as opposed to the Arduino IDE.
B: Resolve egregious memory leaks and logic errors in the original code.
C: Refactor the code to increase readability and ease of debugging.
D: Finish the code this time.

Parts list: (May change in the future)
Arduino Mega
Arduino Motor Shield Rev3
RPLIDAR A1M8 Scanner
Half of a 1/24th scale RC tank I had lying around (Will be replaced by a more customizable chassis if issues arise)
